    <h3> Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for
         about an hour now. On her desk, lying between
          the copies of <i> Nature,</i> <i>New Scientist,</i>
           and all the other scientific journals her work had
            appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>
                On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite
                 book since college, and the longer she spent

    with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaming that <q> Work is the refuge of 
        people who have nothing beter to do

      something beter to do.
